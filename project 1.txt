This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into one of three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on their physical measurements. The classification is achieved by training a machine learning model on the dataset of iris flower measurements.

While the Scikit-learn library provides a built-in Iris dataset, an external dataset can also be used to explore this task in-depth. This project demonstrates a complete pipeline, from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment.

The dataset contains measurements for:

Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
Each record is labeled with one of the three iris species:

Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica


To run this project, you need the following:

Python 3.x
Libraries:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
jupyter Or Visual Studio code

Results
Expected accuracy: >90% on the test dataset.
Insights:
Petal measurements are more significant for classification than sepal measurements.
Setosa is easily distinguishable, while Versicolor and Virginica overlap slightly.
